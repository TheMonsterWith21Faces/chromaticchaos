A TTRPG gambling game

Simulates rolling 2d20, 1d12, 3d6, 1d4 in the background. Visualizes the results on a Big 6 style wheel. Payouts are intended to slightly favor the player.

Legal notice

I accept no legal responsibility if you decide to use this in stupid, illegal ways it was never intended for. Do not use this for REAL gambling. There's a good chance it's illegal in your area and, what's more, the payouts aren't balanced for that.

AI Policy

Yes, I used AI in the creation of this and your opinions on that fact do not matter to me even a little. <3
